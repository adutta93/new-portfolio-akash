# <h5>Akash Dutta</h5>

Hey, I'm a <span style={{color: "blue"}}>Software Engineer</span> at [TBD Health](https://www.tbd.health/).
I enjoy working with Next.js and crafting beautiful front-end experiences.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/).
It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
