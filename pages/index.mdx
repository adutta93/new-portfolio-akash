# <h5 className="my_name_heading">Akash Dutta</h5>

Hey, I'm Akash.

I'm currently a <span className="home_desc_title">Senior Software Engineer</span> at [TBD Health](https://www.tbd.health/)
and <span className="home_desc_title">Principal Developer at Akash Dutta Technologies.</span>

I'm passionate about technology, the web, the internet, and the intricacies of software development. With over
5 years of experience, I designed and built application for the Healthcare, Finance, Education and many more domains.

Beside programming, I'm also passionate about many creative pursuits, including music, travelling, playing cricket, and of course, food. This
combination of interests is what ultimately led me to my current role in building a successful carrer in tech.
